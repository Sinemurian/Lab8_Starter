# Lab 8 - Starter
1. (OPtion 1) because we can ensure that the tests are being run the same way every time, and on the most up-to-date version of the project, and also automatically.  Option 2 allows for human error on each developper's part although it should probably be done as well (to be sure everything works) just not relied on.  Option 3 seems like a complete disaster.
2. No, because it does not involve an action on the user's part
3. Yes, you can simulate a user sending a message and check both the message text and that the other user recieved the message in a single unit test
4. Yes, you can simulate the user typing an 81 character long message and then check if the text in the message is > 80 characters in a single unit test
